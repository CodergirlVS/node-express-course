when using fs with promise we dont need to provide the call back function.

error handling:

parse time err
course time err - try/catch
built in err
syntaxError - err mesage

finally will always run

Response status code:
200: ok
400: error with request
401: request unauthorized
404: resouce was not found

res.writeHead (status code, headers (MIME types), optional body)
res.write - to write the data on the webpage. If headers specify content-type as 'text/plain or text/html or application/jason'
res.end() - ends the response we are sending.
res.send() - sends the reponse to the client.

npm i express --save
EXPRESS:
All static files can be moved to public folder and then we dont need to provide path as its available for the app to render. 

res.use(express.static(directory path
))

There are 2 options to get or send data (http interface):
API - json                     SSR - Template
send Data                      send Template
res. json                      res.render()

Q why did the code work when we passes 400 in the Headers? -http-app.js
cos that 400 in WriteHeader is just the code we are sending the browser and not the actural response status code.
